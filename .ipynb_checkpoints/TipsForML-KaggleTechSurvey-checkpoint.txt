**On dataset size**
Yes, 1,259 rows is a perfectly reasonable size for machine learning with scikit-learn, especially for clustering and basic predictive models. That said, a few things to consider:

âœ… You're in a good spot if:
Youâ€™re working on a classification or regression problem that isnâ€™t super high-dimensional (i.e. youâ€™re not creating hundreds of dummy columns).

You're not trying to train a very deep or complex model (like a deep neural network â€” which scikit-learn doesn't do anyway).

Youâ€™re using cross-validation or at least a holdout test set to properly evaluate your model.

ðŸ’¡ A few tips given your survey data:
One-Hot Encoding:

pd.get_dummies() or sklearn.preprocessing.OneHotEncoder works great.

If you have a lot of columns with many categories, consider dropping one level (i.e. drop_first=True in get_dummies) to avoid multicollinearity for linear models.

For yes/no variables, simple binary encoding (0/1) is perfect.

Clustering:

Preprocessing is key! Especially:

Standardizing numeric/scaled values (StandardScaler).

Encoding categorical features consistently.

PCA or t-SNE can help with dimensionality reduction before clustering, especially if you're creating many dummy variables.

Model Performance:

For 1,000â€“1,200 rows, models like:

Logistic regression

Decision trees

Random forests

KMeans or DBSCAN for clustering
will all handle this well.

Just watch for overfitting, especially with too many dummy variables and not enough samples.

ðŸ§  Rules of Thumb:
Aim for at least 10â€“30 samples per feature for stable predictive modeling. So if you're ending up with 100+ features after encoding, try feature selection or dimensionality reduction.

In clustering, focus more on structure, not accuracy. Try plotting with PCA or UMAP to visually explore clusters.
