# MHealthWorkplace-Tech
Build a machine learning model that predicts mental health outcomes based on workplace (tech) factors; factors collected via psych-style survey.

## NOTES TO SELF:
### Potential Target Feature?
- obs_consequence: Have you heard of or observed negative consequences for coworkers with mental health conditions in your workplace
- mental_vs_physical: Do you feel that your employer takes mental health as seriously as physical health?
- mental_health_consequence: Do you think that discussing a mental health issue with your employer would have negative consequences? (compare to physical consequence somehow?)
