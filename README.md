# MHealthWorkplace-Tech
Build a machine learning model that predicts mental health outcomes based on workplace (tech) factors; factors collected via psych-style survey.

## NOTES TO SELF:
### Potential Questions
- correlations between obs_consequence and whether got treatment for MH condition?
- is family history a bigger predicter than workplacce MH being vlaued in the workplace?
- does a unsupportive work environment make it less likely that somene will get treatment for MH? does unsupportive make it more likley for MH to interefe with work?
- does company size (no_employees) correlate with how supportive or unsupportive the company is toward MH?
- does remote work environment correlate with less need for MH intervention, less negative consequences for MH, MH interfereing in work?
- even if it is a tech role, does the company typer correlate with MH attitudes or MH tx-seeking/need?
- benefits for MH vs MH attitude (correl b/n these, how each correl with MH outcomes -- interfere work, negative conseq)
- does what a worker see as negative conseq for physical needs correl perception/fear/no tx for MH needs?
